eliza is a set of API designed to simplify the storage of information for web
sites and applications. The concept is kiss (Keep It Simple Stupid!) feed 
classes define how information is stored, which eliza uses to create 
collections of feeds ready to be echoed.


What she features
-----------------

* eliza organizes feeds into collections.
* eliza can handle feed requests addressed to the service.php file; 
  the output can be configured to be either JSON or XML. 
* ElizaService.js implements all the asynchronous calls to service.php. 
* eliza makes use of pseudo-tags in order to directly render collections 
  into HTML. 
* eliza implements a basic check for privileges based on roles and 
  permissions, configurable in the global config.php.
* eliza has a simple buffering and caching system for your pages.
* eliza already provides some types of feed that you can extend: Node, File, 
  Image, XMLDocument.


How she works
-------------

Basically, all you need to work with eliza are two files, a feed class and 
a html template or page (and some stored information, of course).

An example of feed:

    class AFeed extends eliza\XMLDocument {
        public $AValue;
    }


An example of page:

    <?php include 'eliza.php'; ?>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
        </head>
        <body>
            [AFeed /]
        </body>
    </html>
